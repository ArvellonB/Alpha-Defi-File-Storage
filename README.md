Paradisum
Paradisum was designed to be the blockchain that would power the Amadeus ecosystem, a multi-chain project meant to bridge major blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Although Paradisum itself was never fully developed, Amadeus, the coin associated with the project, did launch and is available on Etherscan. However, Amadeus was never officially released to the public, but it holds a ton of potential for future development.

Project Background
Back in 2021, Paradisum was conceived as a blockchain project that would revolutionize cross-chain interactions, enabling users to move assets seamlessly between networks and engage with DeFi tools. Although Paradisum didn’t see the light of day, the Amadeus coin was deployed on Ethereum. While it remains unreleased to the public, the project still offers a lot of promise.

Features of the Amadeus Ecosystem
Cross-Chain Interoperability
Amadeus is designed to bridge multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, and BSC, allowing users to transfer assets freely and interact with decentralized financial products. This means complete freedom to move assets across chains, making DeFi more accessible.

The Amadeus Launchpad
Amadeus isn’t just about cross-chain transactions—it was designed with a feature-rich Launchpad to help new projects get off the ground. It integrates with major decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as:

Sushiswap
Quickswap
Julswap
Uniswap (v1 & v2)
Pancakeswap v2
Honeyswap
The launchpad includes:

Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO)
Token Launcher
Liquidity Locker
Token Locker
Farms
This ecosystem offers everything a new project needs to launch, secure liquidity, and grow within the community.

Decentralized Voting and Governance
Amadeus is built with a checks-and-balances system that allows the community to vote on which projects are trustworthy and secure enough to launch on the platform. This governance model puts the power in the hands of the investors, ensuring only the best projects make it through.

The Buyback-but-Not-Burn Feature (Smart Treasury)
One of the standout features of the Amadeus ecosystem is its Automatic Buyback System tied into a Smart Treasury. Instead of the standard “buyback-and-burn” process used by other tokens, Amadeus has a unique buyback-but-not-burn system.

Here’s how it works:

When Amadeus earns income (in ETH), it’s deposited into the Smart Treasury. Whenever the ETH in the treasury exceeds a certain threshold (10% of its total value), the treasury automatically uses that ETH to buy back ADUS tokens. However, instead of burning these tokens (which can cause short-term price pumps but long-term liquidity issues), these tokens are recycled back into the system.

These repurchased tokens are used as incentives for liquidity providers and stakers. This creates a self-sustaining cycle where tokens are continually flowing through the system, supporting both liquidity and rewards without destroying the token supply.

Why This is Better than Burning Tokens
Traditional token burning can sometimes lead to a temporary price increase by reducing the token supply, but it also means those tokens are gone for good, which can cause liquidity problems down the line. With Amadeus, the buyback-but-not-burn approach keeps liquidity strong while supporting a healthy price floor. The bought-back tokens are always reissued as rewards, so there’s always a reason for people to stay engaged with the network.

It’s a win-win: token value goes up, liquidity remains solid, and the ecosystem stays sustainable.

Tokenomics
The Amadeus ecosystem is designed with a simple, sustainable tax system:

Tax Breakdown (8%)
3% goes to automatic ETH rewards for holders.
3% goes into the Liquidity Pool.
1% goes to the Expense Wallet for ongoing project costs.
1% goes to the Charity Wallet.
Liquidity Lock
Amadeus’s liquidity is locked for 100 years, ensuring long-term stability and confidence for investors.

Buyback Distribution
60% of the buyback ETH goes directly into the Liquidity Pool.
40% goes to the Expense Wallet.
The Automatic Buyback Mechanism
Here’s where it gets even better. The Smart Treasury automatically balances itself using the Balancer protocol. Whenever the ETH in the treasury exceeds a 10% threshold, it’s used to buy back ADUS tokens. This not only helps to maintain the price but ensures liquidity stays intact. The whole process is automated, so there’s no need for external keeper bots or complex manual buybacks.

The Amadeus Smart Contract
Even though the full project hasn’t been released to the public, the Amadeus smart contract is live and available for viewing on Etherscan. I posted two links for verification
